# SERVIN Official Web Page

This is a project for the official webpage for Servicios Industriales S de RL located in Honduras, Choloma. This enables them a place to present their services to the public as well as enabling an easy path for comunicaction with their clients.

## Content

This project contains the react app for the web page as well as the react components it is build with. Most of the indivual components can be reused in a general scope. The main dependency that is used in a couple of components is Bootstrap. Sass was also necessary to edit some of the bootstrap variables.

The project can be divided into the following categories:

-Home

-Company

-Services

-Projects

-Contact Info

Given the necesity for the administrators of the webpage to update its content, a separate interface was developed where they can interact with the database hosted in Firebase where they are able to add, erase or edit the projects they are working on.
